Project Overview

The Orders Cleaned with PySpark project demonstrates data cleaning and transformation techniques using PySpark. It includes steps for loading raw order data, performing data cleaning operations, and saving the cleaned data for analytics or machine learning applications.
Features

    Data Cleaning: Removes duplicates, handles missing values, and standardizes data formats.
    Data Transformation: Extracts and structures important information from complex data columns.
    Efficient Processing: Leverages PySpark's distributed computing for handling large datasets.
    Modular Code: Each step in the data pipeline is modular, making it easy to update or extend.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.10 or higher
    PySpark
    Git

Steps

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/saadyaq/Orders_cleand_with_pyspark.git
cd Orders_cleand_with_pyspark

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Activate the virtual environment if it's not already active:

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Run the PySpark script to process the data:

    spark-submit orders_cleaned.py

    This will clean the raw order data and output the processed data.
